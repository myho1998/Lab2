# Lab2
## Summary about this lab project
For this lab assignment, I decided to do the research on Seattle, Space Needle and Canada Place. 

The parameter I used to work on is from the 15th of January up to now. It is about 5 days are enough to see hundred amount of data and in 20.07 miles is the buffer distance I want to work on.

I want to make this comparison between these 3 locations because I want to see the flequency and how offen people mention about and live in these areas. The result comes out do not suprise me. Seattle was mentioned the most. It looks like Seattle is the hottest area between those three.
The reason I want to work on these places is that there is no reason. I just feel like I want to do somthing around me so I can imagine this lab easily. And if the result was too different from my thought, I might do it wrong. But luckily, I did it right. I am getting to like this project.
